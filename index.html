               and customers is paramount to sustaining a seamless flow of 
               materials or inputs that fulfill the manufacturing needs. 
               This symbiotic connection guarantees the assurance of timely 
               delivery and shorter lead times, contributing to operational 
               efficiency. By actively cultivating this relationship,

            <p>In today's competitive market, customers expect transparency 
              and timely information on purchase orders, delivery lead times,

              prompt information and replenishment of critical spare parts 
              are crucial to maintain an uninterrupted supply chain.

              To meet these demands, we leverage the power of Relational 
              Database Management System (RDBMS) and web development technologies. 
              This enables us to create a comprehensive and user-friendly 
              web platform that assures customers of their needs. 
              By implementing an RDBMS, we ensure that all critical 
              information is stored and managed efficiently, enabling 
              quick retrieval and analysis.

        <h2>Quality Management Systems (QMS) Practitioner | Consultant | Web Developer</h2>
        <p>With over two decades of experience as a QMS practitioner, I have overseen the design, development, 
          and implementation of quality management systems. Throughout my career, I have held various roles, 
          including Management Representative, Internal Auditor, and Documentation Specialist. 
          My expertise extends across Training, Customer Relationship Management, Business Development, 
          Human Resources Management, Quality Assurance, Web Development & IT, and Design and Development.</p>

        <p>In addition to my work within my organization, I have had the privilege of providing consultancy 
          services to two other companies, guiding them towards ISO 9001 QMS certification. 
          My unwavering focus has always been on customer satisfaction, striving to deliver high-quality 
          services that precisely meet their needs.</p>

        <p>Having retired in mid-2018 due to health reasons, I embarked on a new journey of teaching English 
          to Chinese students. This endeavor has proven incredibly fulfilling as I have formed strong bonds 
          not only with my students but also with their parents. To enhance communication, I dedicated myself 
          to learning Mandarin.</p> 
          
          <p>In recognition of my dedication, I was honored with the prestigious Best 5-star 
          teacher award in 2020 and 2021. I have successfully passed the TESOL certification.</p>
